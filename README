This project was born out of another project which used hardware based counters to track position for both PPI and engraving.  Since the speeds are much lower with vector cutting and there are quite a few people out there who use Retina engrave and/or a DSP which currently do not do PPI, there was a lot of interest in having a simple add on to enable that kind of control.  This code will work on a single Atmega 328 chip to do PPI and will be put on a custom board that can plug right into a 25 pin parallel port.  The 328 is fast enough to handle PPI at almost any reasonable cutting speed.
